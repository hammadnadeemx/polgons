## Turing Artificial Intelligence
### Job Position: Geometry Developer (Contract)

### Test Objective
The goal of this test task is to examine your proficiency in **geometric algorithms design & implementation**. Additionally, it aims to evaluate your problem-solving skills and your ability to work with **C++**. There is no time limit for the submission but to give you an idea of the complexity of the problem, an ideal candidates would be able to complete it in 72 hours. Feel free to take your, at Turing AI, we are not looking for candidates with perfect solution but rather a candidate that have correct approach to the problem.


### Task Description

Implement a C++ program that performs a set of set operations on a collection of polygons. The program should support the following operations:
1. **Union**: Combine multiple polygons into a single polygon.
2. **Intersection**: Find the common area among multiple polygons.
3. **Difference**: Subtract one set of polygons from another.

##### For example:
Given two simple, non-self-intersecting **polygons A and B** in a 2D space wih **difference** as *operator*, the program should calculate the resulting polygon C, representing the **subtraction of polygon B from polygon A**.

### Requirements

##### Programming Language: C++
##### Input:
Define a format to represent a set of polygons and their relationships (e.g., union, intersection, difference). You can choose the input format that you find most convenient (e.g., as function parameters, from standard input, or read from a file).
##### Output:
Output the resulting polygons for each operation. Implement handling for cases where the result is an empty polygon (no intersection, no union, etc.).
##### Libraries:
Feel free to use standard template library.
##### Code Quality:
- Focus on writing clean, well-documented, and efficient code.
- Include comments explaining the logic of your implementation.

##### Bonus Points:
- Implement error handling for complex cases (e.g., overlapping polygons, self-intersecting polygons).
- Optimize the algorithm for efficiency, especially for a large number of polygons.
- Provide visualization of the input polygons and the resulting polygons.

##### Submission
- Share your solution via a public code repository (GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.) with clear instructions on how to build and run the program.
- Include a README file explaining your approach, any assumptions made, and instructions for testing.

##### Evaluation Criteria
- Correctness of the implementation.
- Efficient use of C++
- Code clarity, organization, and documentation.
- Handling of edge cases and invalid input.
- Bonus points for additional functionality, optimizations, and visualization.
